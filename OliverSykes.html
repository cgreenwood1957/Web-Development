                <p>Some people are a lot like clouds, you know
                  'Cause life's so much brighter when they go
                  You rained on my heart for far too long
                  Couldn't see the thunder for the storm
                  Because I cut my teeth and bit my tongue
                  'Til my mouth was dripping blood
                  But I never dished the dirt, just held my breath
                  While you dragged me through the mud
                  I don't know why I tried to save you 'cause
                  I can't save you from yourself
                  When all you give a shit about is everybody else
                  And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
                  I think it's time to stop</p>
