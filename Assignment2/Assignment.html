                  <p style="color:rgb(252, 2, 252);">This sentence is purple by using p style colour (selecting the colour)
                  the colour of that sentence then becomes purple, see below for the code used.</p> 
                  <p>                                          </p>
                  <p>Internal CSS - 
                  This is Where a singlular style is used on the webpage such as turning elements of the website a different colour 
                  for example h2{backround-color:rgb(110, 0, 0) }, this will change the title of the webpage to a dark red. Which you 
                  can see down below. <p>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="AssignmentColumn2">
                <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">Information about my assignment </h2>
                <p>External CSS - 
                    This is used to characterize the style for the webpages, using a CSS file where the website can be customised into what 
                    the creator wants the website to look like as well as have certain aspects on it such as a red navbar. A picture of the code 
                    will be provided at the bottom of the webpage.</p>
                    <p>                                                </p>
                <p>CSS Box Model - 
                    This is used when the planning the design and layout of a webpage, which takes into consideration with
                    margin, padding and border. As you can see in my assignment page i have use a white border going around each
                    of the columns to clearly layout that they are there.
