                <p>Falling in Reverse is an American rock band based in Las Vegas, Nevada that formed 
                  in 2008 by lead vocalist Ronnie Radke while he was incarcerated. The band's original 
                  name was 'From Behind These Walls,' but was quickly renamed to Falling in Reverse

                <p>The Drug In Me Is You</p>
                <p>I heard a knock upon my door the other day
                  I opened it to find death staring in my face
                  The feel of mortal stalking still reverberates
                  Everywhere I go I drag this coffin just in case
                  My bodies tremblin' sends shivers down my spine
                  Adrenaline kicks and shifts into overdrive,
                  Your secrets keep you sick your lies keep you alive
                  Snake eyes every single time you roll with crooked dice
                  I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
                  The kind of dark that haunts a hundred year old house
                  I wrestle with my thoughts I shook the hand of doubt
                  Running from my past I'm praying feet don't fail me now!</p>
