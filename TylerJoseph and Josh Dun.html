                <p>Car Radio</p>
                <p>I ponder of something great
                    My lungs will fill and then deflate
                    They fill with fire, exhale desire
                    I know it's dire my time today
                    I have these thoughts, so often I ought
                    To replace that slot with what I once bought
                    'Cause somebody stole my car radio
                    And now I just sit in silence
                    Sometimes quiet is violent
                    I find it hard to hide it
                    My pride is no longer inside
                    It's on my sleeve
                    My skin will scream reminding me of
                    Who I killed inside my dream
                    I hate this car that I'm driving
                    There's no hiding for me
                    I'm forced to deal with what I feel
                    There is no distraction to mask what is real
                    I could pull the steering wheel</p>
