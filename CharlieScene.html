                <p>Knife Called Lust</p>
                <p>Let's go right now
                  I look alive, I'm dead inside
                  My heart has holes, and black blood flows
                  We'll do some drugs, we'll fall in love
                  And get fucked up while the world just shrugs
                  With no thought logically
                  We're wandering the streets so aimlessly
                  I hate to see these kids just being
                  Put down so painlessly
                  And people say you dye your hair and wear tight jeans
                  That doesn't mean that you can't scream and like loud noise
                  You got a choice, you have a voice
                  And just because you show no love
                  And hate on us, you fucked our trust
                  Now watch me thrust this knife called lust
                  Into my chest until it bursts</p>
